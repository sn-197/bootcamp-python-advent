This part of the bootcamp covers Python fundamentals with 6 progressive examples:
1.	Hello World - Basic output
2.	Variables - Variable assignment and printing
3.	Data Types - int, float, str, bool
4.	Arithmetic Operations - Basic math operations
5.	Conditional Statements - if/else and logical operators
6.	Mutable vs Immutable Values - Understanding Python data structures

📚 Exercises to Study and Learn

(i) Practice Tips
Run Each Example - Execute the example files to see the output
Modify Examples - Change values and re-run to understand behavior
Start Simple - Begin with Level 1 exercises before moving to challenges
Debug - Use print() statements to check variable values
Comment Your Code - Explain what each line does
Test Edge Cases - Try boundary values (0, negative, empty strings, etc.)

One last tip: Before you start exercising, create a folder for your exercise-files.


Level 1: Basics (Examples 1-2)

Exercise 1.1: Personalized Greeting

# Create variables for your name, age, and city
# Print a personalized greeting message using all three variables
# Expected output: "Hello, [Name]! You are [Age] years old and live in [City]."

Exercise 1.2: Multiple Variables
# Create 5 variables with different information (e.g., favorite color, hobby, year born)
# Print each on a separate line with a descriptive label
# Example format: "My favorite color is: [color]"

 
Level 2: Data Types (Example 3)

Exercise 2.1: Type Discovery
# Create variables of each type: int, float, str, bool
# Use type() to print the type of each
# Then perform one operation on each (e.g., multiply the int, concatenate the str)

Exercise 2.2: Type Casting
# Create a variable with a number as a string: "42"
# Convert it to an integer and perform math on it
# Convert a float to an int and observe what happens
# Convert an integer to a string and concatenate it with another string

Exercise 2.3: Data Type Guessing Game
# Given these values, identify their data type without running code:
values = [42, "Python", 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3], False, "100"]
# Write your predictions, then verify with type()


Level 3: Arithmetic (Example 4)

Exercise 3.1: Simple Calculator
# Create two variables for numbers
# Calculate and print: sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder (using %)
# Also try: power (using **) and floor division (using //)

Exercise 3.2: Area and Perimeter
# Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle
# Variables: length = 10, width = 5
# Area = length × width
# Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

Exercise 3.3: Temperature Conversion
# Given a temperature in Celsius = 25
# Convert to Fahrenheit: F = (C × 9/5) + 32
# Print both with labels

Exercise 3.4: Order Total Calculator
# Create variables for: item_price, quantity, tax_rate
# Calculate: subtotal, tax_amount, total
# Print each step clearly


Level 4: Conditionals (Example 5)

Exercise 4.1: Grade Checker
# Given a score (e.g., score = 85)
# Use if/elif/else to determine and print the grade:
# 90-100: A, 80-89: B, 70-79: C, 60-69: D, Below 60: F

Exercise 4.2: Even or Odd
# Given a number, check if it's even or odd
# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%)

Exercise 4.3: Eligibility Checker
# Check if someone is eligible to vote (age >= 18) AND has a valid ID (has_id = True)
# Use 'and' and 'or' operators in different conditions

Exercise 4.4: Number Range
# Given a number, check if it's:
# - Negative, Zero, or Positive
# - Within range 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, or Outside all ranges

Exercise 4.5: Login Validator
# Create variables for: username, password, age
# Check all conditions:
# - Username must not be empty
# - Password must be longer than 5 characters
# - Age must be at least 13
# Print appropriate messages for each case


Level 5: Mutable vs Immutable (Example 6)

Exercise 5.1: String Immutability
# Create: original_name = "Alice"
# Create: new_name = original_name
# Reassign: original_name = "Bob"
# Print both and explain why they're different

Exercise 5.2: List Mutability
# Create: list_a = [1, 2, 3]
# Create: list_b = list_a
# Modify list_a: list_a.append(4)
# Print both and observe the difference from exercise 5.1

Exercise 5.3: Reassignment vs Modification
# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# numbers_copy = numbers
# numbers = numbers + [4, 5]  # Reassignment
# Print numbers and numbers_copy - what's the result?
# Explain why this differs from using .append()



Challenge Exercises (Combine All Topics)

Challenge 1: Simple Banking Program
# Variables: account_holder, balance, transaction_amount, transaction_type
# - Check if transaction type is "deposit" or "withdrawal"
# - For deposits: add to balance
# - For withdrawals: check if balance is sufficient, then subtract
# - Print the new balance

Challenge 2: Movie Ticket Pricer
# Variables: age, is_student, is_senior, movie_time
# - Child (< 13): $8
# - Student (13-18 or is_student): $10
# - Adult (19-64): $12
# - Senior (>= 65 or is_senior): $9
# - Matinee (before 5pm): -$2 discount
# Calculate and print final price with breakdown

Challenge 3: Day Categorizer
# Given: day_of_week (1-7 representing Mon-Sun)
# Categorize as: Weekday or Weekend
# If weekday: suggest "Work day"
# If weekend: suggest "Rest day"
# Print with explanations

Challenge 4: Password Strength Checker
# Variables: password (string)
# Check:
# - Length >= 8
# - Contains at least one number
# - Contains at least one uppercase letter
# - Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
# Print: Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong based on criteria met
